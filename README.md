Day 1 : 27/03/24
Spring Boot, which is a popular framework for building Java-based web applications. I learned how to create RestControllers, Services, and handle RESTful APIs in Spring Boot. I also explored the use of Spring Boot's built-in testing features, and performed basic CRUD operations using Spring Boot, Hibernate, and JPA (Java Persistent Access). I learned about the GetMapping, PostMapping, PutMapping, and DeleteMapping annotations, and how to use them to handle different types of HTTP requests.

Overall, it was a productive day of learning and exploring new technologies!

Day 2 : 28/03/24 
Great, it sounds like you had a productive day of learning!

Working with CRUD operations in Spring Boot is an essential skill for any backend developer. By creating a model for an employee and controlling its behavior using a controller, you were able to get hands-on experience with the basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) that are commonly used in web development.

Hibernate is a powerful Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool that simplifies the process of working with databases in Java. By using Hibernate methods, you were able to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on the employee model.

Additionally, working with the collection framework in advanced Java is a valuable skill to have. The collection framework provides a set of interfaces and classes that allow you to work with collections of objects in a more efficient way. By using the collection framework, you can sort, filter, and manipulate data in a more organized and efficient way.

Overall, it's great to hear that you're making progress in your learning journey! Keep up the good work!
